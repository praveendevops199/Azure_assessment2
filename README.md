Esoda Health is a major health care solution provider, with currently having two data centersLos Angeles (10.1.0.0/20) and 
New York City (10.2.0.0/20). These two data centers currently divided into standard three tier network architecture, 
and  host 100+ VM’s that supports web applications, API’s and SQL Databases. Each datacenter also has its own firewall and load balancers. 
Based on current projections there was an increase in traffic in the next year, so company has decided to migrate the data centers in 
Cloud in two regions (EastUs and WestUs) to support HA, and with peering back to on-premise data centers.
